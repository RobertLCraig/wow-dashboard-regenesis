# Rewrite this board's cards for the reader

## Why
**A card on this board opens with the answer and never says what is wrong.** On 2026-08-18 Rob said
most of the cards he was handed made him work backwards: they lead with candidate solutions and
their costs, so he has to reverse-engineer the problem out of the proposals. He cannot tell whether
the options are the right ones, because he does not yet know what they are for.

**Two more faults, in his words.** Cards ask him to settle things an agent could have researched and
applied. And a bare card number dropped into a sentence tells him some other card matters and
nothing about why, so he opens it to find out.

**What it costs.** His attention is the only scarce thing here. Measured on 2026-08-20, 258 of 398
open cards across the estate fail at least one of these rules and 257 of those fail on the link rule
alone. A card that reads badly costs a round trip; one that should never have been surfaced costs
the whole reading for nothing. Enough of either and he stops opening the ones that mattered.

**How it came to be this way.** Every card here was written by an agent against a convention that,
until 2026-08-18, said nothing about stating the problem first, nothing about whether a question was
a person's to answer at all, and nothing about how to name another card. It gained all three rules
that day, and nothing was applied to the cards, so this board is measured against a standard none of
it was written to.

**Relates to**
- `progressboard#0065` - the estate-wide rewrite this card was seeded from; its pilot over
  ProgressBoard's own 40 cards is the worked example of a pass.
- `progressboard#0066` - the five checks the count below is measured with, and why each is
  structural rather than a judgement about prose.

## Not this card
**Changing the convention.** `docs/board/README.md` here is a COPY of a canonical file outside every
repository, so an edit to it is destroyed silently on the next distribution. This card applies the
convention and never changes it.

**Rewriting cards in `done/` or `discarded/`.** Those are a record of what happened. Rewriting a
record is falsifying it, and nobody reads them to decide anything.

**Deleting anything.** A badly written card still holds facts somebody measured. A rewrite keeps
everything the card knows and changes only how it is ordered and said. `## Direction` and
`## Decided` are append-only: do not edit them, on any card, for any reason.

**Any other board.** Each one carries its own copy of this card, worked in its own repository.

## Acceptance
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 WHEN a card in a non-terminal lane is rewritten, THE CARD SHALL state the problem in
      `## Why` before any solution appears anywhere in it. proves: none - about prose, and no check
      here reads prose
- [ ] #2 WHEN a rewritten card is a decision, THE CARD SHALL say which of the four reasons makes it
      a person's to answer, or SHALL be converted to a feature card whose `## Plan` records the
      practice applied and its source. proves: none - the command that counts it is in another
      repository, named in `## Plan`
- [ ] #3 WHEN a rewritten card names another card, THE CARD SHALL name it in a `## Links` section
      with the relationship type and one line of why, and SHALL NOT leave a bare card number in a
      sentence as the only mention of it. proves: none - as #2
- [ ] #4 THE `Blocked by` LINES on every rewritten card SHALL match that card's `needs:` frontmatter
      exactly, in both directions. proves: none - as #2
- [ ] #5 THE REWRITE SHALL preserve every measurement, date and decision the card already carried,
      and SHALL NOT edit `## Direction` or `## Decided`. proves: none - as #2
- [ ] #6 WHEN this board's rewrite is finished, THE BOARD SHALL report zero open cards failing the
      checks. proves: none - as #2
<!-- AC:END -->

## Tasks
- [ ] Read the count, and write it into `## Direction` before changing anything
- [ ] Rewrite `human-review/` first, then `todo/`, `in-progress/` and `ai-review/`
- [ ] For each decision card, apply the four-reason test and convert the ones that fail it
- [ ] Read the count again and write into `## Direction` what changed, counted by rule

## Plan
**Where to stand.** This repository, on whatever branch the session was given. Nothing outside it is
edited and no card changes lane. **The one command, from this board's directory, in PowerShell:**

    php C:\Dev\ProgressBoard\artisan board:convention --path=$PWD

It prints one tab-separated line: board name, OPEN cards failing the checks, open cards, the next
free card number, and the directory read. The second number is this card's finish line and it must
reach 0. Run it before the first edit and after the last. `--path` matters: a build worktree is not
`C:\Dev\<board>`, and without it you measure a tree you are not editing.

**What the checks look for is in `docs/board/README.md` here**, three sections of it: "`## Why` is
the PROBLEM, and it comes before any answer", "Links: say what the relationship IS, never a bare
card number", and "Is this actually a person's to decide?". Read those three first. Every check is
structural - a missing `## Links` section, a `Blocked by` line that disagrees with `needs:`, a link
with nothing after the dash - so each flag names one thing to fix and none is an opinion.

**`human-review/` first, and that is not tidiness.** That lane is the only one a person reads. A
`todo/` card is read by an agent, a reader with different problems, so rewriting those first spends
the session on the half nobody is complaining about.

**Expect the four-reason test to shrink the queue rather than reformat it.** A decision whose answer
turns on established practice is not Rob's: research it, apply it, and rewrite the card as a feature
card whose `## Plan` says what was applied and where it came from. Count those separately from the
cards merely rewritten - that is the change that gives him evenings back.

**If the board is too big for one session, stop cleanly.** Tick nothing, write the count you reached
into `## Direction`, and leave the card where it is; the next session carries on from that entry. A
part-rewritten board is normal. A card ticked off a board that is not at 0 is not.
